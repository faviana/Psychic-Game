1.  create an array of the alphabet
2.  define my variables
        a. wins (start at zero)
        b. losses (start at zero)
        c. guesses:
            *left (interger - give a number of tries) 
            *made (string - starts at empty)
4.  start a function when player presses a key
5.  determine the key that player pressed
6.  computer chooses a random letter
7.  if statements
        a.if (player letter = computer letter) {player wins --> add a winner point}
        b.else (guess again) {one less guess}
        c.if (no more guesses) {player looses --> add a loser point}
9.  Document wins by referrence of their id
10. Document losses by referrence of their id
11. Document guesses left by referrence of their id
12. Document guesses made by referrence of their id 

NEEDS WORK:
1.  Guesses Left doesn't stop at 0 it continues to -1,-2...and so on
2.  Guesses Made doesn't keep track of the numbers player selected
3.  to play again... don't use confirm command
